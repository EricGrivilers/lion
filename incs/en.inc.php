<p>The Immobilière Le Lion agency was created in 1970 and has specialized throughout the years in the sale of high quality and top class properties in the most sought after residential neighbourhoods of Brussels and surrounding areas.
</p><p>The agency has also been very active in the rental market since the very beginning.
</p><p><p class=yellow><img src='medias/bullet.gif' align=absmiddle><b>Our services – Our way of working</b>
</p><p>The evaluation of properties for sale or for rent is clearly the first service that we offer to clients and we offer this free of charge.
<br>Complete discretion is guaranteed at this stage and can continue throughout the process of the sale or the rent of the property if the client desires so. 
</p><p>An initial contact does not commit you in any way; A second interview can serve to better define the particular nature of your objectives and the service you require.
<br>Finally, a contract including the mutually agreed goals as well as the code of practice proscribed by the Chamber of Real Estate is sent to the client. Our 30-year membership to this professional association is testimony to our reputation and a guarantee of our professionalism.
</p><p>We are also qualified to go beyond the traditional services of real estate agency by offering our clients the benefit of our advice on tax, investment and other matters.
</p>
<p class=yellow><img src='medias/bullet.gif' align=absmiddle><b>Our field of action</b>
</p><p>We offer our clients a large number of serious prospective buyers, both Belgian and international, due to our privileged contacts with major international financial and real estate companies.
<br>Our range of properties extends beyond Brussels and its surroundings and includes large estates throughout the country.</p><p>We are therefore able to offer potential buyers and renters details on a wide and varied range of properties.
<br>Our staff is always pleased to show interested persons around the properties, giving them the opportunity to appreciate their respective merits at their leisure.
</p><p>To widen our field of available properties, we maintain close contacts with a number of colleagues who are able to provide additional information on additional properties.
<br>We allocate a large part of our budget to advertising so that our properties can be presented to prospective customers in Belgium and abroad.
</p><p>We look forward to working with you. Please contact us at +32 2 672 71 11 or at info@immo-lelion.be if we can be of service to you.</p>";
